Coconut examples
================

Examples of [Coconut](http://coconut-lang.org/) code for my talk at Lambda Lounge Manchester.
Admission of guilt: many of these are stolen from the excellent docs at https://coconut.readthedocs.io/en/master/DOCS.html

To use this repo:

1. Run `pip install coconut`
2. Install the excellent [watchdog](https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog) utility: https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog#installation
3. Run `builder.sh` to build the coconut files into python files and watch for changes.
